Spring 2023 Tidyverse create and extend assignments

Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment, weâ€™ll be practicing our knowledge of Tidyverse functions by creating vignette examples of the packages that make up Tidyverse. In my case, I wanted to attempt going over the forcats package which focuses on manipulating factor elements in a dataframe, as I have no experience with using it at this point.

I've chosen `ggplot2` as my tidyverse package to showcase and worked with a dataset from Kaggle showing the number of internet users for various countries between the years 1980 and 2020.

Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment dplyr was utilized to conduct a superficial analysis of the 'Music
Dataset : 1950 to 2019' which provides a list of songs 'from 1950 to 2019 describing
music metadata as sadness, danceability, loudness, acousticness, etc.'  More
specifically, dplyr was used to analyze aspects of the 'sadness' variable to demonstrate
the main functions of the dplyr package.  The final product is a playlist of songs between the years 1950-2019 which includes the top one 'saddest' song from each genre for each year.
